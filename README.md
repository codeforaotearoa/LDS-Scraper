### Basic LDS Scraper

Just note that this is a tiny utility for generating a list of the datasets that are on the [LINZ Data Service](https://data.linz.govt.nz).

This will not let you actually scrape the LDS data itself.

I should also note that I don't know Python so this also counts as my first actual Python tool if you like.

At the moment, it only scrapes the front page for names but the results are stored as a CSV file.

I intend to also add Upload Date, Views and Downloads once I learn more about BeautifulSoup and what not.
